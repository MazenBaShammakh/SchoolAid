# SchoolAid

SchoolAid is an application that allows people around Malaysia to donate to poor schools or to apply to teach in them, if they are qualified teachers. Nowadays, poor children have limited access to education as they cannot afford the tuition fees and school materials. That is why SchoolAid is intended to motivate the society to donate school materials or money, or even their energy into voluntary work represented by teaching those unfortunate children. This application will help to facilitate learning materials for the poor children and poor schools from various backgrounds: isolated geography to urban area. The application will provide 2 main options for users to choose: volunteering services or donation. As for the
admin of SchoolAid, a Non-Government Organization will be updating users about schools and their needs.

## Main Features
